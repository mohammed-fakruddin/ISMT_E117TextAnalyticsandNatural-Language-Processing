# NLPLinguisticSearchEngineForFundIndustry
# Objectives
The business objective is to provide the large and growing number of average investors with a sophisticated search engine which can help bridge the gap between the legal language of a prospectus and the vocabulary of retail investors. To achieve the objectives, a linguistic search engine was built using advanced NLP text similarity algorithms to match an investor's simple text query to the language of the prospectus, allowing someone without intimate knowledge of the investing industry to find mutual funds matching their risk appetite and objectives.
